From this File you can get a basic code for doing the selenium automated-testing using the chrome driver.
one test is of gmail and the other is based on the springbootDemo.
so inorder to test the other file i.e of springbootDemo first download my spring_render_html folder run it on your machine and then run the selenium test for it.
